# The Challenge

It's time to play now :)

To introduce you to our midgard (Tolkien feelings ^^) we need to know how much you are aligned with us,
to check that we have prepared a little challenge with some checkpoints that you need to reach.

Here is a list of what you will need to complete the challenge:
-   A computer with internet (hehe obvious isn't it ?)
-   Free account for <a href="https://goo.gl/1gzFRE" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/GQRLct" target="_blank">AWS (Amazon Web Services)</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>

Okay, to the challenge now...

    Pretend that you are a DevOps Engineer at Stone Co. and your manager has designated you to help a new development team that will work in a revolutionary product for the company.
    After a few meetings with your new team, you have decided to use Jenkins as your CI/CD tool, your team chose to use Node.js  with React as the official tech stack.
	You are not sure on which cloud service you will use yet(that's why you need a free account of Azure or AWS, it's time to choose!)
	Your team needs a lab ready to test their first features.

Right, now that you have a hint of what your team needs, let's move forward.

- Once you clone this repo, you will note that we have a "source" folder, inside that folder you will find a  simple react application.
- To run this application you must do as follows:
 1. Run "npm install" command.
 2. Run "npm start" command.

Oh my God! there was a lot of information right ?

Yeah there was, but now you have all what you need to start the game.

Here are some of the checkpoints to guide you through this quest:
- You must rise a Jenkins application on any cloud service you chose.
- Your Jenkins server must be public so we can access with a user that you will provide (with administrator privilege please!).
- You must use slaves to run your builds on Jenkins.
- Your job must use continuous integration approach.
- Continuous deployment will be a plus.
- You must create a Jenkins job that will deploy your app.
- You might want to use Docker to run your application, if you choose this way it will be a plus, we like containers ;)
- All tasks should be done with some IaC Tool (Ansible , Puppet, Bolt, Chef...).
- We want to change the user and password for the Jenkins, so please use variables when you think
  its fit. 
- Will be helpfull if you write a small text explain why you chose that IaC tool.
- You can use any opensource lib, but you need to explain why you chose that one and references that
  on docs.
- Docs Docs Docs. We know that writing docs its not the coolest thing ever, but we need to know how
  to run your scripts. So documentation will be evaluated in the same way as your code. 

Once you have finished, you must send an email to challenge@stone.com.br with the following information:
- Repository URL
- Jenkins URL with user and password (we might want to take a look in your job).
- Published app URL.

Useful Words:
- Ansible
- Docker
- Puppet
- Makefile
- CentOS
